Welcome to the official documentation website of Eiland-X!

## About Eiland-X

Eiland-X is a group of IT-enthousiasts, who also happen to be great friends, that focus on system management, automisation and maintenance. We enjoy automating and perfecting workflows that allow for an increase ease-of-use, performance and efficiency. 

## Mission

We aim to improve our knowledge of IT-systems whilst having fun exploring them. Cooperation, knowledge sharing and enthousiasm are the driving factors for the software, infrastructure(-as-code) and systems we create. 

## Skills

Besides general IT-skills, troubleshooting and problem-solving, we focus on the follow aspects of IT:

- Dockerisation: packing and deploying (custom) software using Docker

- CI/CD: creating and maintaining pipelines for quality-ensurance, testing and deployment

- Webhosting: management of WordPress hosting and backing up these systems

- Game servers: hosting a collection of game servers for personal use (using mainly steamcmd, Pterodactyl and Docker containers)

- Monitoring: experimenting with creating open-source monitoring systems (Grafana, Prometheus, Node-exporter, Alertmanager, Uptime Kuma)
