Below you will find a collection of tools that we use and/or have used in the past. We will try to keep this list up-to-date and add new tools as we go along. 

## Development

### [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is a great tool for building APIs and we have used it in the past to create a simple web interface to generate QR-codes.

### [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)
Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, using uvloop and httptools. We have used Uvicorn to serve our FastAPI application and it has been a great tool for us.

### [Composerize](https://www.composerize.com/)
Composerize is a tool that allows you to convert docker run commands into docker-compose files. It is a great tool to quickly generate a docker-compose file from a docker run command.

## Creation and generation
